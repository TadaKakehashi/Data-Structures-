# Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in **nodes**, and each node points to the **next** node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, **linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory**.
---
## Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List** – Each node has:
   - Data
   - A pointer to the next node

2. **Doubly Linked List** – Each node has:
   - Data
   - A pointer to the next node
   - A pointer to the previous node

3. **Circular Linked List** – The **last node connects back** to the head, forming a circle.

---
## When to Use a Linked List
- When you need **frequent insertion and deletion**
- When **random access is not required**  
  (Random access means directly accessing any element using an index, like in an array)
